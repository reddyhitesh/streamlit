HI Todd, 
 
Jeff and I looked into SAP for the forecasts in place and discovered that the 60AKG and the 80AKG are not in SAP yet since they have not been engineering released. Based on our forecast for the 40AKG and the 50AKG the numbers currently funneling through are correct.

We currently have a tool in China and now one in Mexico which we will be dual sourcing from . The capital requistion has already been approved and in process. The cost savings estimates is a conservative approach depending on the success of the FAIR's. All details are outlined on the attachment.

Update 3/27/24: Northwest notified Curtis that they had made a mistake quoting our parts due to an underestimated machining cycle time issue. Price out of Mexico is now $9.98 opposed to the original $8.65. In addition Curtis China recently negotiated a cost down which now brings the tariffed cost into PR at $10.95. The new cost savings is ~$.97 per unit which is still postive. Even if price was neutral, sourcing in Mexico is a stragetic move and should be fully supported. Advantages of reduction in Lead-time, simplify ocean freight and the need to hold less inventory easily justifies the continuation of this project.

Total volume estimated @ 50k yearly down to 20k as of 11.22.24 

However, in addition: 888 ETB / 999 VAVE programs intend on using for fuel rails as developed & will profliforate cost savings introduced by design of 25 294 71 (Y fuel fitting) - at a later date to deplete stock of current fitting. 

Estimated cost savings per Y fitting of $1.53 as a replacment of 25 294 50 summary below. 
25 294 71 (NEW) 2024 std cost: $0.293
2025 STD Cost:$0.293

Phased implementation: 1st (ECV999 ETB - warranty reduction) 2nd (ECH999 VAVE - replace and void old) 3rd (888 ETB program intends to utilize)

Implementation for warranty reduction planned to be started 05.01.25, benefits start date currently reporting after depletion of stock on old parts 06.01.26 with the 12 month savings kept at 14650 yearly benefit for warranty reduction claims of full year, to be aligned after reviewing internally 04.16.25 - Updatedin 12 month to be accurate for prior calculated warranty reduction.  Benefit will be updated after volume confirmation and revisit for accuracy - Start Date is estimate for depletion of stock for production parts on hand, new part replacements are to be used in a future implementation plan for ECH 999 models after runout.  BB tracker needs to be updated, without access today. DLC 04.25.25

Review of ACT for volume comparison revealed that 14190 was included as savings for annual warranty reduction, it was not dependant on the volume sold.  We are leaving the 12 month benefit as it is close to the ACT value.  Unsure when the update to value was made.  Leaving as is due to matching values.

Removed savings and timing for 25 048 11, PB2481 is new number.  See below for details:

PB1464 is now only for 25 048 10 VOID and replace with 25 048 17 where used.  CN108179 at external review with purchasing 01.27.25, with EDS Boms being updated 02.25.25
Summary of savings: 25 048 10 ($62.26) Void & replace with 25 048 17 ($22.27) + 24 126 191 ($16.22) = ($38.49) (Can & Hoop total) : Saving per engine $23.77 x 2400 EAU 
Annual savings of $57000

3/13 Update - Savings start date is at risk. 

3/20 update - Trying to get all PO's that we can cancel, cancelled. Still working with purchasing to get issues resolved. Push the savings start date. GVS nelson is the supplier. Work with Francisco's manager

04.10.25 - No benefit to cancellation, service will take 1 year worth max and value is to be reduced as carrying inventory cost. Benefit to be updated for 2025 to be updated to 31,400. Monthly schedule to be updated in tracker spreadsheet for months savings will start.  09.01.25 start of savings date as of note.  Delay in consumption of inventory pushes start of savings start date. 

Review of stock uncovered date of savings now 11.01.25 based on decreased demand.  Investigating service stock profliforation, low margin spec use and root cause of dramatic demand decrease on these air cleaner specs and align cross functionally on best next steps.  Will need to involve sales, program management, service, and purchasing for cost / benefit review of business goals if counter productive for stock depletion.","Misty Herren","Bruce Lefeber",,,"Francisco Cruz","11/1/2026","CMT Small H/V: HDAC canister consolidation from Nelson to Donaldson","CMT Small H/V: HDAC canister consolidation from Nelson to Donaldson","VA/VE Cost Reduction"

This change will allow for more effective large-quantity pre-season ordering and stocking at CDs and dealers – enabling better in-season responsiveness to customer unit-down situations at dealers.  Along with this change, we will increase service spec minimum order quantity to 8 (from 1) and allow orders in multiples of 8 only. No investment required.

5/12 - this project will be cancelled and here is why
I would like to cancel this project, and this is the justification for it

1) The maintenance cost savings on the Unisig is happening without eliminating the lighting hole.  With or without the lightning hole, the Unisig is being replaced later this year.  So that savings is not applicable.  
2) The only lightning hole tooling that will be eliminated is a single form tool that we spend ~$4600/year on.  Blake was including tooling cost for the Unisig in his calculations.  Again, that cost goes away when we replace the Unisig.  It is not associated with eliminating the lightning hole.  
3)There is no headcount reduction for eliminating the lighting hole.  The headcount reduction is associated with the slip fit gear design, not the eliminating the lightning hole. 
4) The gear press maintenance is not associated with eliminating the lightning hole, that too would be associated with the slip fit gear design.

The spacing between the leads on this component is extremely small and it is therefore very prone to solder bridging during wave soldering (a rate of ~25% of boards). 

Working with Curtis California and Curtis Puerto Rico, we were able to obtain and validate a version of the hall sensor where the component leads are formed/spread to increase the spacing and correct the solder bridging problem during wave soldering. This version of the component also reduces the rate of calibration fails because it locates the hall sensor in a better position with respect to the toroid. Therefore the savings is based on labor, and avoiding additional calibration/re-test, touch-up and debridging, post touch-up cleaning, and the extra handling and logistics associated with these failures.

The change is expected to be ready in 2025, and the exact savings start date will also depend on use-up of the existing component.",,"Wilson Santos",,,"Alondra Santos","7/1/2026","VA/VE - Melexis Hall Sensor Spread Lead Change","VA/VE - Melexis Hall Sensor Spread Lead Change","VA/VE Cost Reduction"

Maintenance free valve lash will remain a requirement for this product. This approach is expected to yield up to $50 savings per engine. Mechanical controls will be eliminated on EFI by implementing ETB on all engines, which may yield additional $10 savings for horizontal shaft engines.

Single barrel Confidant carb could help resolve performance issues that customers expierence with our 2-barrel CMD engines.
Calibration work will be required however durability testing should be minimized since the Command Twin block is proven.
New tooled parts could be backwards compatible with next gen 747 engine.
Potential for this engine configuration replace all existing 1-barrel and 2-barrel service specs.
Potential to carry across savings to Command Twin horizontal in the future.

Note - The cost reduction increases from $50 to $200 per engine if the baseline spec is a 1-barrel carbureted engine such as CV740-3126 which is currently $791.00 per engine.

2/18 Update - Received quotes from Maryweather foam. Next step is to meet with SWRI to understand and approve the change. Required burning sample material but not the entire units

3/19 update - Joshua working with NPD team for datasheets. Will continue to work with Milcut. Josh to provide a newer estimated benefit. Savings start date might slip. $175k savings will start from ??? (Josh to confirm with Audra) - New project to be created 

3/26 Update- Saving start date for 2524 will move to be 4/1/2025. Working on calculating savings per unit to update savings estimates and actuals. New project will be submitted once Milcut confirms new insulation costs (due this week). Still working on getting technical product data and historic testing results from NPD team.

3/31/2025 -  Savings start date is now 4/1/2025. 
-Total Savings as a part of Milcut negotation is approx +$225k. VAVE will acount for $175k in project 2524 and anything greater than that will be DM only. After 2524 exceeds $175k Audra will be notified to carry any additional savings over to DM. This is renegoation only and does not include further cost reductions proposed by Milcut using an alternative material. That will be including on a new project to be submitted week of 3/31/2025.

Project 2524:
Savings per unit: 26RCA = $11.14, 20RCA = $3.23, 14RCA = $3.23

2/20 - We should combine with Rahul's project about removing painting on the inside of the Louver. July starting date should be good. 

3/6 - Waiting for supplier to send us parts and then do the salt spray testing. 1000 hour test will be the critical path. Check Generac parts - if they do not do it - we should not do it. 

3/13 update - Savings to reduce as marketing is not ready to approve all surfaces not seen. Need salt spray testing. G057 Spec calls out the spec for 1000 hr salt spray. To review next week

3/19 update - Savings and start date are on track. Josh to complete the discussions on analysis with Vendor by 3/21

3/26 Update - Discussion with vendor complete. Working with Yin/Audra to identify who is the responsible party for writing the ACT. Components will have to be spin tested at Rehlko as Excel does not have the capability (Engines spin tests all of thier fans internally from them). 12 months savings total at risk due to next gen timing change.

2/25 Update - Savings estimate and scope still need to be vetted out. 1 peice fitting still requires feedback from purchasing/vendor. Moving to Phase 1 Per Eric's request. P0/M0 required items are not confirmed

3/12 Update - Got feedback from the vendor. Josh to send the markup drawing on 13th march. Vendor is expected to send the quotations

3/19 update - Recieved quote from Vendor on 3/16. Material and finish request is not satisfactory. Steel vs Brass vs Stainless steel (cost considerations)

3/26 Update - Steel is the most cost effective path forward. Working on providing a summary of proposed changes to the marketing team due to corrosion concerns - zinc plating vs paint. If  not approved, design will change to update the fitting to not extend outside of the enclosure and not align with next gen. 

4/9 Update. Project at risk due to massive tariff increases. Still waiting on marketing's feedback but tariffs are a much larger roadblock.

4/15 Update. Savings with tariffs will be estimated as soon as we understand cost increases on current parts: X-206-4, X-216-49, X-202-41, X-209-6, X-216-20. 

Working with Audra to meet with Ferguson on project, driving USA sourced solution or off the shelf. 

4/21 Update. Met with Ferguson to discuss project scope. Before a custom fitting is sourced though them, they are sending off the shelf samples of a potential option. These may be much shorter than desired, but worth reviewing.  Cannot update milestone dates until samples and costs are initially vetted. May not meet 4/30 date for M2, but may be close if off the shelf parts are feasible.
